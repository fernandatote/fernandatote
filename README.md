### Hi, I'm Fernanda Toledo 👩🏻‍💻

As a Front End Developer, I have over 4 years of experience in developing web applications that leverage blockchain technology and provide engaging user experiences. Previously at [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), I have been involved in the creation and maintenance of [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) and [NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/), two of the most successful and popular blockchain games.

With over 11 years of experience working on startups, I am a fast learner, a team player, and can easily adapt to changes. My mission is to deliver pixel-perfect websites that reflect the design vision and user needs.

My core skills include React, JavaScript/TypeScript, Next.js, HTML/CSS, UI/UX, responsive design, GraphQL, Git, GitHub, WordPress, agile methodologies, Contentful, Figma, and others.
